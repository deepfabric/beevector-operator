# Hyena Operator


Hyena Operator manages [hyena](https://github.com/infinivision/hyena) clusters on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and automates tasks related to operating a Hyena cluster. It makes Hyena a truly cloud-native distributed vector searcher.

> **Warning:** Currently, Hyena Operator is work in progress [WIP] and is NOT ready for production. Use at your own risk.

## Features
